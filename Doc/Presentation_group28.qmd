## Introduction

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 80%;"}
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a serious health concern and identifying gene markers associated with the disease can help catch it early in new patients.

Our analysis is focused on

-   Identifying gene markers

-   Identifying key over- and under-expressed genes

Looking into co-expression of key genes

**Data set overview:**

-   14481 different genes

-   63 samples

    -   9 with T2D

    -   54 controls

**Descriptive statistics:**

-   Similar mean gene expression across groups

-   Overall low mean expression levels

-   Slightly right-skewed distribution

-   =\> Investigate significant difference of genes between the groups

## Methods - Median Expression Differences {.smaller}

Lena - **Goal:** Identify genes with largest expression differences between T2D and control

\- **Approach:** - Compute **median** expression per gene for T2D and control samples - Calculate absolute differences between groups per gene

-   **Visualization:**
    -   Plot 30 genes with the most different expressions
    -   Bar plot and boxplots

## Methods - p.value

1.  Transform data

2.  Pivot Longer

3.  Nest the Log Fold Changes

4.  Creating linear regression models for each gene

    -   lm(log_fold_change \~ disease.state)

5.  Select genes from significant p-values

## Discussion

1\) Difference in two methods

2\) Sum up which genes are found by the analysis

3\) does they support the litterature? uniprot...
