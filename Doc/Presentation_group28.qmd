## Methods - Median Expression Differences

- **Goal:** Identify genes with largest expression differences between T2D and control
- **Approach:**  
  - Compute **median** expression per gene for T2D and control samples
  - Calculate absolute differences between groups per gene
- **Visualization:**
  - Plot 30 genes with the most different expressions
  - Bar plot and boxplots

## Discussion / Conclusion

1\) Difference in two methods

2\) Sum up which genes are found by the analysis

3\) does they support the litterature? uniprot...
