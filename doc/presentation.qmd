## Introduction {.smaller}

**Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)** is a serious health concern. Identifying and understanding gene expression patterns associated with the disease can help uncover underlying biological mechanisms and could potentially support earlier detection.

**Our analysis is focused on:**

-   Identifying gene expression markers

-   Identifying key over- and under-expressed genes

-   Looking into co-expression of key genes

**Data source:**

*"A Systems Genetics Approach Identifies Genes and Pathways for Type 2 Diabetes in Human Islets"* *(PMID: [22768844](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22768844 "Link to PubMed record")) (GEO ID: GDS4337)*

**Data set overview:**

-   14481 different genes

-   63 pancreatic islets samples

    -   9 with T2D

    -   54 controls

**Descriptive statistics:**

-   Similar mean gene expression across groups

-   Overall low mean expression levels

-   Slightly right-skewed distribution

-   =\> Testing for significant differential expression between the two groups

## Materials - Wrangling

![](../results/wrangle.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods - Median Expression Differences {.smaller}

**Goal:** Identify genes with largest expression differences between T2D and control

**Workflow:**

1.  **Compute median expression** per gene for T2D and Control

2.  **Calculate absolute differences** between group medians per gene

3.  **Rank genes** by largest absolute difference

4.  **Visualize top genes**:

    -   Bar plot of top 30 genes (median differences)
    -   Boxplots of sample-level expression variation for top 10 genes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods - P-values {.smaller}

**Goal:** Identify genes with largest expression differences between T2D and control

**Workflow:**

-   Compute Linear Regression Models

    -   lm(log_fold_change \~ disease.state)

-   Interpret the Slopes: difference between T2D and control

    -   Positive slope --\> Higher gene expression

    -   Negative slope --\> lower gene expression

-   Select significant genes on p-values

## Discussion {.smaller}

**Key takeaways**

1.  Major differences between our methodologies in terms of results

    -   Flipped tendencies in terms of found genes

    -   Genes present in each method kept same orientation

2.  Four genes clearly stand out in terms of expression differences

    -   IL7R

        -   Very over-expressed with some co-expression (one of which is an IL ligand)

    -   FGF7

        -   Also over-expressed with co-expression with other over-expressed genes

    -   GLRA1

        -   Under-expressed with negative correlation to all over-expressed genes

    -   RASGRP1

        -   Under-expressed with negative correlation to all over-expressed genes
